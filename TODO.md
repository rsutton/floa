# TODO
- "update now" button? instead of updating on startup?

- ensure data is sorted by volume number in library, if a new item is inserted into 
catalog it should be inserted into the library at the proper location, not simply 
appended.
- consider name change of Libary.library, it is a list of status numbers - state?
- export/import to/from json
- bulk update/multiple item selection in UI
