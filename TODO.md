# TODO

- bulk update/multiple item selection in UI

- LoA checks for updates on startup. For long running server this
    needs to be at least daily.

- multiple user/libraries?
  - ~~library.catalog belongs in LoA - only need 1 instance~~
  - Library needs to be refactored so that User has their own
  - at user logon, check catalog and apply updates to their library
  - oauth
  - move library persistence to User object
