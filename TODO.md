# TODO
- "update now" button? instead of updating on startup?
- ~~show number of items on bookshelf~~
- ~~ensure data is sorted by volume number in library, if a new item is inserted into 
catalog it should be inserted into the library at the proper location, not simply 
appended.~~
- ~~consider name change of Libary.library, it is a list of status numbers - state?~~
- export/import to/from json
- bulk update/multiple item selection in UI
- ~~figure out why search button sometimes reloads page~~
  - ~~needs e.preventDefault()~~
- maybe move init_app to Library from __init__.py
- ~~friendly error pages for 404 and 500~~
- ~~refactor init_app to use ctx~~
- multiple user/libraries?
- remote connection error handling
